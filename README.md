# Managing Stock Overflow

A Node.js app using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/). A mock stock photo site.

This application supports the [Getting Started with Node on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) article - check it out.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/) installed. Once this repository has been connected with Heroku, you may enter the following commands into a bash to run locally.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/CSC-648-SFSU/csc648-su18-Team04.git
$ cd csc648-su18-Team04
$ npm install # dependency may already be up to date
$ heroku local web
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

## Deploying to Heroku

Merge the 'Development' branch with the 'Master' branch. Then deploy from Heroku's website by navigating to the tab Deploy and select the button Deploy Branch.
